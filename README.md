This is the repository for our tutorials and posts on [gis-ops.com](https://gis-ops.com/tutorials).

We :heart: open source, so we chose to open our tutorials as well, which has some nice side effects:

- Contributions from external users via Pull Requests help to keep the tutorials updated
- Write and deploy posts and tutorials from the comfort of our favorite IDE and git client

If you find the idea interesting and you're also hosting a WordPress blog, you can install our Wordpress plugin [Markdown Github](https://github.com/gis-ops/md-github-wordpress).

## Contributions

If you find issues in our posts or tutorials, please either file an [issue](https://github.com/gis-ops/tutorials/issues) or, even better, provide a PR against the `master` branch with some explanatory resources.
